//English (Original)

"Genetic engineering refers to the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology. 
It involves the modification of DNA through various methods such as gene cloning, gene editing, and the transfer of genes between organisms. 
While genetic engineering has led to advances in medicine, such as the development of genetically modified insulin, its application in agriculture has raised concerns about the long-term effects on human health and the environment. 
For instance, genetically modified crops may crossbreed with wild species, leading to unintended ecological consequences. 
Furthermore, the potential for creating superweeds resistant to herbicides is a growing concern among environmentalists and agricultural scientists. 
The ethical implications of genetic engineering, particularly in the context of human germline modification, are also being debated extensively within both scientific and public spheres."




//Mandarin (Translation)

“基因工程是指使用生物技术直接操控有机体基因组的过程。
它包括通过各种方法修改DNA，例如基因克隆、基因编辑以及基因在有机体之间的转移。
虽然基因工程在医学领域取得了诸多进展，例如开发了基因改造胰岛素，但其在农业中的应用引发了对人类健康和环境长期影响的担忧。
例如，基因改造作物可能与野生物种发生杂交，从而导致意想不到的生态后果。此外，可能产生对除草剂具有抗性的超级杂草，这一问题正受到环境学家和农业科学家的广泛关注。
基因工程的伦理影响，尤其是在人类生殖系修改的背景下，也正在科学界和公众领域广泛讨论。”



//Explanation of Key Terms

"Genetic engineering" → "基因工程"
"基因工程" is the standard term for "genetic engineering" in Mandarin scientific discourse.

"Genome" → "基因组"
The term "基因组" is widely used to represent "genome" in biological sciences.

"Gene cloning" → "基因克隆" and "Gene editing" → "基因编辑"
These are standard translations, as "克隆" refers to cloning and "编辑" means editing.

"Genetically modified insulin" → "基因改造胰岛素"
"胰岛素" (yídǎosù) is the direct translation of insulin, with "基因改造" indicating genetic modification.

"Unintended ecological consequences" → "意想不到的生态后果"
This phrase is translated to reflect the precise scientific meaning, with "生态后果" (ecological consequences) and "意想不到" (unintended).

"Superweeds resistant to herbicides" → "对除草剂具有抗性的超级杂草"
The phrase "超级杂草" (superweeds) and "抗性" (resistance) clearly convey the meaning in Mandarin.

"Human germline modification" → "人类生殖系修改"
This scientific term is translated accurately with "生殖系" (germline) and "修改" (modification).

"Ethical implications" → "伦理影响"
"伦理" (ethics) is commonly used in Mandarin to discuss moral and ethical issues in science.
