//Key Considerations in Medical Translation

Clarity and Precision:
Avoid ambiguous terms. Use professional terminology recognized in both English and Mandarin medical communities.

Context-Specific Terminology:
E.g., "tissue" translates as 组织; ensure it's contextually appropriate, as it could mean "fabric" outside medical contexts.

Simplified or Traditional Chinese:
Use Simplified Chinese (简体中文) for Mainland China and Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) for Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau.

Cultural Sensitivity:
Certain expressions might need adaptation for cultural relevance, such as explanations about informed consent, which could differ in emphasis across regions.

Accuracy in Risks and Benefits:
Clearly specify technical risks (e.g., 过敏反应, "adverse reactions") and ensure they are medically validated.
