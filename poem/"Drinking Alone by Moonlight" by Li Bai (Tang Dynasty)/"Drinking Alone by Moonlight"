Chinese: 
花间一壶酒，
独酌无相亲，
举杯邀明月，
对影成三人。

English Translation: 
A pot of wine among the flowers,
I drink alone with no one around.
I raise my cup to invite the bright moon,
And with my shadow, we become three.

Translation Notes: 
This poem conveys a moment of solitary reflection, 
where the poet invites the moon and his shadow to join him in his drinking, 
expressing a deep sense of connection with nature despite being physically alone.
