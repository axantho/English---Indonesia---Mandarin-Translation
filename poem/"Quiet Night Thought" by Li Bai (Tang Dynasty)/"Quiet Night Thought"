//Mandarin: 
床前明月光，
疑是地上霜。
举头望明月，
低头思故乡。

//English Translation: 
The bright moonlight before my bed,
I suspect it’s frost on the ground.
I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon,
And lower it to think of my hometown.

Translation Notes: 
This poem by Li Bai reflects a sense of homesickness and the beauty of nature. 
The simplicity of the lines and the melancholic tone are captured in this translation.
