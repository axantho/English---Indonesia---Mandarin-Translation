Chinese: 
春眠不觉晓，
处处闻啼鸟，
夜来风雨声，
花落知多少。

English Translation: 
I sleep through the spring dawn, unaware of the day,
All around me, the sound of birds chirping.
The wind and rain come in the night,
How many flowers have fallen, I wonder?

Translation Notes: 
This poem paints a peaceful, yet slightly melancholic, picture of spring mornings. 
The poet reflects on nature’s changes and the fleeting nature of beauty, symbolized by the falling flowers.
