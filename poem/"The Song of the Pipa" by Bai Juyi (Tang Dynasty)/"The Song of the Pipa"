Chinese: 
我曾停杯投璧山，
落日照大地，
黄金堆尽抚琴的手。

English Translation: 
I once paused my cup and threw my jade disc into the mountain,
The setting sun cast its light over the land,
And golden stacks lay before the hand that strums the zither.

Translation Notes: 
Bai Juyi’s poem paints a vivid picture of both the literal and emotional landscape, using powerful imagery. 
The reference to the pipa (a traditional Chinese stringed instrument) evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia.
