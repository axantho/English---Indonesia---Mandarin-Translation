Chinese: 
君问归期未有期，
巴山夜雨涨秋池，
何日不见君，
使我心断肠。

English Translation:
You ask when I’ll return, but I cannot say,
The night rain in Bashan swells the autumn pool,
How long until we meet again?
The thought alone breaks my heart.

Translation Notes: 
This poem describes the poet’s longing for his wife while separated by distance. 
The use of nature’s elements, like the night rain and autumn pool, heightens the emotional atmosphere of the poem.
